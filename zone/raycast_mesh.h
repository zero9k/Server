// This code snippet allows you to create an axis aligned bounding volume tree for a triangle mesh so that you can do
// high-speed raycasting.
//
// There are much better implementations of this available on the internet.  In particular I recommend that you use 
// OPCODE written by Pierre Terdiman.
// @see: http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm
//
// OPCODE does a whole lot more than just raycasting, and is a rather significant amount of source code.
//
// I am providing this code snippet for the use case where you *only* want to do quick and dirty optimized raycasting.
// I have not done performance testing between this version and OPCODE; so I don't know how much slower it is.  However,
// anytime you switch to using a spatial data structure for raycasting, you increase your performance by orders and orders 
// of magnitude; so this implementation should work fine for simple tools and utilities.
//
// It also serves as a nice sample for people who are trying to learn the algorithm of how to implement AABB trees.
// AABB = Axis Aligned Bounding Volume trees.
